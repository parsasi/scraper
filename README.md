# Boilerplate Scraper

This repo is just a boilerplate, for creating scraping scripts with Playwright.


## Getting Started
To watch the project:
 - run `yarn dev`. 
 - Then to run a test case, open another terminal. Navigate to the root; and, run `yarn try [name of the file]`. 
 
 For Example: 
 ```sh

 ```
 and
 ```sh
 yarn try index
 ```
